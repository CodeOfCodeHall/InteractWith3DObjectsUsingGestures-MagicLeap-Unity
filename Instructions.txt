How To Use These Scripts

There's a full tutorial over at:

1. Create New Magic Leap Project
2. Import the libs folder from the Magic Leap Unity Examples package
3. Create a 3d Cube (Assets > 3D > Cube)
4. Set the position of the cube to 0,2,3
5. Set the rotation to 0,65,0
6. Add a Rigidbody to the cube
7. Disable Use Gravity on the Rigidbody
8. Add the TouchCubeCollider.cs to the cube (Add Component > Scripts > TouchCubeCollider.cs)

9. Create an Empty Game Object and rename it to Gestures
10. Add the GestureDetection.cs script to Gestures
11. Create a 3d Sphere as a child of Gestures
12. Reset the transform on the sphere
13. Set the scale to 0.2, 0.2, 0.2
14. Add a Rigidbody to the sphere
15. Disable use gravity
16. Set the public variable Finger on the Gestures object to the sphere.


Play! You should see a white cube in the simulator, set the gesture to either the L or the Finger gesture and alter the positions to 0,2,2.4 to touch the cube. The cube should turn blue and react to the collision by moving and rotating.

Any problems check out the full tutorial over on CodeofCodeHall.co.uk and leave a comment letting me know what's not working for you and I'll try and take a look.

Have Fun!!!
